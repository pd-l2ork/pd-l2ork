BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
------------------
To build for Pd-L2Ork (pd-vanilla setup may be similar with some subtle changes in the include paths and likely does not require MSYS environment, so on Windows changes may be more significant):



1) Set up a build environment:

On Windows follow instructions on setting up the MSYS2 environment for Pd-L2Ork (make sure it matches your OS in terms of 32-bit vs 64-bit--most modern iterations of Windows are 64-bit). Info on how to do this can be found here: https://github.com/pd-l2ork/pd-l2ork/blob/master/README.md#windows-32-bit-using-msys2

On Linux and OSX make sure you have your build gcc environment all set up (consult the OS documentation)



2) Install the Sensel lib for your OS found at https://github.com/sensel/sensel-api/tree/master/sensel-install



3) Using a terminal (in Windows use the MSYS2 MinGW 32-bit shell) go into this folder and run the following command (these options are assuming you have everything installed in a default path--if you don't you will need to adjust paths accordingly):

Linux: make pdincludepath=/usr/include/pd-l2ork/

OSX: make pdincludepath=/Applications/Pd-l2ork.app/Contents/Resources/app.nw/include/pd-l2ork/

Windows: make pdincludepath=/c/Program\ Files\ \(x86\)/Pd-L2Ork/include/pdl2ork pdbinpath=/c/Program\ Files\ \(x86\)/Pd-L2Ork/bin/



4) If everything compiles correctly, you should be able to run Pd-L2Ork and open the sensel-help.pd to test it out.



Currently, the external only supports detecting of individual contact points and their traits. Future revisions should focus on outputting the grayscale matrix of the surface pressure in a Gem-compatible format (and/or using other Pure-Data-compatible matrix formats that may be used by alternative visual data processing libraries).

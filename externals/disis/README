Based on wiimote external by Mike Wozniewki (Feb 2007). This project uses a fork
of the CWiid library by L. Donnie Smith

You must have the appropriate bluetooth packages installed and working on your system in order to connect to the Wiimote.

To test this, type the following in a terminal:
> hcitool scan | grep Nintendo

you should get a response that looks something like:
  00:19:1D:70:CE:72    Nintendo RVL-CNT-01

you can also use 'lswm':

> lswm -l

you should get a response that looks something like:

  Put Wiimotes in discoverable mode now (press 1+2)...
  00:21:47:C6:4A:1A 0x002504 Nintendo RVL-CNT-01

currently there are no known issues with using this external.
